Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common reason of progressive dementia in the elderly population. There has been an exponential rise in the number of cases of Alzheimer's disease worldwide emphasizing the necessity for developing an effective treatment. According to Alzheimer's Association, in 2016, an estimated 5.4 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimers disease. One in nine people aged 65 and above has Alzheimers disease. By 2050, the number of people aged 65 and above affected with Alzheimers disease is expected to nearly triple, from 5.2 million to an expected 13.8 million, excluding the development of medical advances to avert or cure the disease. The mortality rates due to Alzheimer's disease are quite high.
