Intravenous transfer of blood or blood products is known as blood transfusion. Replacement of lost blood components can be done with the help of blood transfusion. Blood components like red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, clotting factors and plasma are mostly transfused. These blood components are of great importance to laboratories and hospitals during an emergency or a critical case of large volume of blood loss. RBC transfusion is done when hemoglobin levels fall below 100g/L. Blood collected from the donor has to be screened for a number of infectious disease before transfusion. Thus, blood transfusion diagnostics play an important role in blood transfusion in order to avoid infection to both the receiver and healthcare staff.
